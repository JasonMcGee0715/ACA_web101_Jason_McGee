                <p>Overall, I am outgoing individual that likes just 
                    about anything and gets along with just about 
                    everyone.  I have a background in the U.S Marine Corps as well as
                    radio, statellites, and automation controls. I am here for a career change
                    into something I would like to do more that also has much more flexibility as 
                    well as great pay and room for advancement.<br><br>Overall, I'm looking
                    to bring my career in this new direction for the betterment of not only myself 
                    , but also that of my family.  I feel it would offer me so much more oppurtunity 
                    and put me in a much better position in the future.
