                         <h3>Gumball Machine Repairman</h3>
                        <p>
                             For a few years now I have installed, repaired, and training numerous individuals
                             on the art of repairing old-fashioned machines.  
                        </p> 
                        <h3>Reindeer Trainer and Racer</h3>                        
                        <p>
                            Have trained hundreds if not thousands of reindeer over the years.  Training 
                            includes weight training, antler music, and racing.  I've won over 100 World Class 
                            Reindeer Racing Circuits and have never been accused of cheating.

                        <p>
                            I have extensive experience in climbing up and down mountains, in ice and snowy 
                            conditions, and in very cold situations. I am also uniquly skilled in traversing 
                            in and out of chimneys.  There is no one else in the world that can touch
                            my records.
